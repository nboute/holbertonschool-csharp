Requirements
General
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
More Info
From this project forward, documenting your code is required!

Use XML documentation comments
XML Documentation Best Practices
All public types / classes and their members should be documented with <summary> tags
Private members should be documented but without XML comments
To enable XML documentation in your project, you must add this line to the PropertyGroup in your .csproj file:
<DocumentationFile>bin\$(Configuration)\$(TargetFramework)\$(AssemblyName).xml</DocumentationFile>
Compiling your project with /doc will create an XML file in the directory specified above. With the .xml in the same directory as the compiled assembly, VSCode will automatically read the XML file and use it to provide tooltips with your documentation. Keep this in mind as you write your comments; they should give the programmer clear, concise information about your methods’ purpose and usage.
